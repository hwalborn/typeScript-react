# typeScript-react

This is a super simple toutorial that I'm following in the typescript docs: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/react-&-webpack.html

Just clone down the repo then run
`npm install && npx webpack` from the proj directory and you're all set!

(It was actually super easy, you should give it a shot)
